## üìà Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build, evaluate, and compare multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest) for predicting automotive fuel efficiency using real-world datasets.  
Key stages include:
- Data preprocessing & scaling
- Model training & comparison
- Feature engineering
- Robust evaluation
- Best practices for reproducibility, optimization, and deployment

## üìù Key Lessons Learned

| No. | Area / Topic                  | What I Learned (Key Insight)                                                                             |
|:---:|:------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Data Preprocessing & Pipeline | Always split data before scaling to prevent data leakage.                                                |
| 2   | Model Implementation          | Knowing when to use Linear Regression vs Random Forest, and understanding the strengths of each.         |
| 3   | Feature Scaling               | Proper scaling improves stability, but scaler choice depends on data.                                    |
| 4   | Evaluation Metrics            | Check multiple metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, R¬≤) for a complete model assessment.                             |
| 5   | Model Comparison              | Simpler models sometimes outperform complex ones when the data is mostly linear.                         |
| 6   | Cross-Validation              | Cross-validation provides robust performance estimates, especially on small datasets.                    |
| 7   | Feature Engineering & Selection | Feature importance and correlation analysis are essential for guiding feature selection and improvement. |
| 8   | Multicollinearity             | Highly correlated features can destabilize linear models‚Äîapply regularization or reduce features.        |
| 9   | Pipeline & Reproducibility    | Pipelines and random states help guarantee reproducibility and reduce human error.                       |
| 10  | Model Persistence & Deployment| Save models and scalers for easy deployment and future predictions.                                      |
| 11  | Hyperparameter Tuning         | Grid search and validation curves help optimize models and avoid overfitting.                            |
| 12  | Memory & Performance          | Optimize data types and use parallel processing to improve efficiency.                                   |
| 13  | Troubleshooting               | Always check for data leakage, scaling errors, and overfitting at every stage‚Äînot just after poor results.|
