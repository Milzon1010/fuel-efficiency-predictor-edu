# 🚗 Fuel Efficiency Predictor – Edu Project

_A hands-on machine learning project for beginners, focusing on car fuel efficiency (MPG) prediction using Python and scikit-learn. Designed as an educational lab with practical steps, clear learning objectives, and interactive exercises._

---

## 📖 Overview

Welcome to your first machine learning project!  
This educational application will guide you step-by-step through the fundamentals of supervised learning, using a real-world dataset to predict vehicle fuel efficiency (Miles Per Gallon - MPG).

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Milzon1010/fuel-efficiency-predictor-edu.git
   cd fuel-efficiency-predictor-edu

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Prepare the dataset:
Place auto-mpg.csv in the data/ folder (sample provided).

Run the main script:
python fuel_efficiency_predictor.py

Or, launch the Streamlit web app:
streamlit run streamlit_app.py

🔬 Dataset Features
| Feature      | Description                        | Range     |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------- |
| cylinders    | Number of engine cylinders         | 4, 6, 8   |
| displacement | Engine displacement (cubic inches) | 100–400   |
| horsepower   | Engine horsepower                  | 60–250    |
| weight       | Vehicle weight (lbs)               | 1800–4500 |
| acceleration | 0–60 mph time (seconds)            | 8–25      |
| model\_year  | Year of manufacture (1970–1982)    | 70–82     |
Target: mpg (Miles Per Gallon)

🤖 Machine Learning Models
Linear Regression: Simple, interpretable, fast. Best for linear relationships.
Random Forest: Handles complex, non-linear patterns and feature interactions. Robust to outliers.

📊 Key Metrics Explained
RMSE (Root Mean Square Error): Average error in MPG units. Lower is better.
MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Mean absolute difference between predicted and actual. Lower is better.
R² Score: Proportion of variance explained by the model. Higher is better.

🧑‍💻 Hands-On Workflow
Step 1: Data Exploration
Step 2: Data Preparation
Step 3: Model Training
Step 4: Model Evaluation
Step 5: Feature Analysis
Step 6: Making Predictions

See code examples and comments in each script or notebook.
